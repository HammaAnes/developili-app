   • The app should offer features such as offline access or automatic synchronization when the internet connection is restored, allowing users to continue using the app even in low or no connectivity conditions.
8. Portability
   • Devlopili should be available across multiple platforms (iOS, Android) with consistent functionality and user experience. The app should be easy to install and run on a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets.
   • The underlying architecture should support future porting to additional platforms or environments, if necessary, with minimal effort.
9. Interoperability
   • The app should be able to interact seamlessly with other third-party tools and services, such as cloud storage platforms, communication tools (e.g., email, chat), and AI models for generating SRS documents and matching developers.
   • API integrations should be secure, reliable, and follow standard protocols to facilitate communication between systems.
10. Testability
    • The app should be designed in a way that makes it easy to test. Unit, integration, and user acceptance tests should be a core part of the development process.
    • Automated testing should be used to ensure that core features (e.g., user registration, profile creation, SRS document generation) continue to function correctly after updates.
11. Flexibility
    • The app should be designed to accommodate future changes or additions to the system without significant rework. New features, such as additional AI models for more accurate developer recommendations, should be easily integrated into the existing framework.
    • The system should be able to adapt to new technological advancements or business needs, ensuring it remains relevant and competitive over time.
